# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide provides a list of topics learned prior to the commencement of Coding Boot Camp. 
It was built to provide a place to record elements learned under each topic i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
Use it as a repository for you to continue to add elements to the relevant topic as you learn more.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.
